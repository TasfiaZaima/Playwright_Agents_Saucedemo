#  Saucedemo Website (Product Details → Cart Automation) Test Project  
### Using Playwright Autonomous Testing Agents (Planner • Generator • Healer)

---
## 📌 Overview

This repository contains automated end-to-end UI tests for the **Product Details → Cart workflow** of the demo e-commerce site:

🔗 https://www.saucedemo.com/

The testing approach uses a **self-healing Playwright Agent System**:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 🧭 Planner | Builds structured test plan from requirements |
| ✍️ Generator | Writes Playwright tests based based on the plan |
| 🔧 Healer | Fixes broken selectors & addresses flaky behavior |

This enables:

✔ Autogenerated UI tests  
✔ Minimal maintenance effort  
✔ Faster regression cycles  

---

##  Scope of Testing

Validates whether users can:

✔ View product details  
✔ Add product(s) to the cart  
✔ Remove product(s) from details or cart  
✔ Maintain session state on refresh / navigation  
✔ Display correct cart badge count  
✔ Prevent add-to-cart without authentication  
✔ Navigate with keyboard accessibility

---

##  Key Functional Areas

- Product → Cart state management
- Single-product add/remove flows
- Multi-product independence validation
- Refresh and navigation persistence
- Unauthorized user restrictions
- Basic accessibility assertions

## Automated Test Scenarios

| ID    | Scenario Name                                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| TC-01 | Add single product from product details page    |
| TC-02 | Remove product from product details page        |
| TC-03 | Add multiple products via multiple detail pages |
| TC-04 | Remove only one item while others remain        |
| TC-05 | Refresh after add/remove — state persists       |
| TC-06 | Add then quickly navigate away (race condition) |
| TC-07 | Assert restriction for logged-out users         |
| TC-08 | Keyboard accessibility + ARIA roles             |

##  Agent Architecture

| Phase                | Agent           | Responsibility                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Planning             | Planner Agent   | Converts requirements → detailed scenario plan   |
| Test Code Generation | Generator Agent | Converts plan → Playwright scripts               |
| Auto-Healing         | Healer Agent    | Detects failures → automatically fixes selectors |
